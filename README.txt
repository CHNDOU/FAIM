----   Brief introduction of FAIM    ----

FAIM is a software for Focus and Aberrations of Ion Microprobe. 

1. FAIM is a new tool to design high quality beam optics for ion microprobe/nanoprobe. 

2. FAIM combines matrix method and raytracing method to be fast and accuracy. 

3. FAIM has been compared with with PRAM, TRANSPORT-PSI, TRANSPORT-PBO, WinTRAX, Geant4-nanobeam and Zgoubi confirming that FAIM is easy to use for the ion microprobe community with competitive accuracy.

Please read the Legal Notices about FAIM before run it. 

----   How to run FAIM                  ----

Written in Matlab, the FAIM need the MATLAB Runtime (free) to run it.  

1. Download and install MATLAB Runtime from https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html. 

1-1 Click the version and platform in the table below that corresponds to the application or component you are using. The version of the MATLAB Runtime is tied to the version of MATLAB.

Note: The default version for FAIM is MCR_R2014a_win64_installer.exe, i.e. R2014a(8.3) 64-bit Windows

1-2 Save the MATLAB Runtime installer file on the computer on which you plan to run the application or component.

1-3 Double click the installer and follow the instructions in the installation wizard.

2. Add the path of the MATLAB Runtime to the computer's environment variables and restart the computer.

3. Double click the FAIM.exe and enjoy beam optics design. 

----   Trouble Shooting    ----

1. The major problem may be caused by the install of  the MATLAB Runtime. Please try to use the MCR_R2014a_win64_installer.exe and install it in "C:\MATLAB\". And add the path.

2. The text in the FAIM window may shift.
